Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has emerged as a crucial technology in remote sensing, providing detailed spectral information for each pixel in an image. This rich spectral data facilitates accurate classification of materials and land cover types, which is essential for various applications such as agriculture monitoring, environmental assessment, and resource management. The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust classification model for hyperspectral images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
In this project, we preprocess the hyperspectral data to enhance feature extraction and reduce noise, followed by the design and implementation of a CNN architecture tailored for HSI classification. The model is trained and evaluated on the Indian Pines dataset, demonstrating its capability to accurately classify different land cover types. The results indicate that our CNN- based approach not only achieves higher classification accuracy but also offers a scalable solution for real-time applications. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of CNNs in advancing hyperspectral image classification, offering a promising approach to tackle the complexities of high-dimensional data.
